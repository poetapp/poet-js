### Release

Semantic release is enabled for this repository. Make sure you follow the right commit message convention. 

We're using semantic-release's default — [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines):

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### PR Review Checklist

* [ ] **Have you tested the changes?**
* [ ] **Is QE review required? If so, has this been reviewed by QE?** (For all new features, review by QE is required. Minor changes which already have passing functional tests may not need a new QE review -- when in doubt, loop in a QE reviewer).
* [ ] **Are there code changes that require new unit tests? If so, are those tests included?** (A separate PR for tests is not appropriate).
* [ ] **Are documentation updates required? If so, does this PR include it?** (Separate documentation PR is generally not appropriate).
* [ ] **Are the added/edited files named appropriately and located correctly in the project directory structure?**
